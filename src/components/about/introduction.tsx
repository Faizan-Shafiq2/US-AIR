            2017 by Dr. Patrick Gbele, a visionary in electrical and optical
            research. Dr. Gbele helped develop the Luneburg lens while earning
            his PhD in Electrical & Computer Engineering from the University of
            Arizona. Today, USAT is powered by a small team of dedicated
            engineers and researchers who challenge the limits of existing
            technology. Weâ€™re an ethical, results-driven, R&D-focused team with
            a deliberate desire to explore the uncharted.
