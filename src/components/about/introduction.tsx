            USAT was founded in 2017 by Dr. Patrick Gbele, a visionary in
            electrical and optical research. Dr. Gbele helped develop the
            Luneburg lens while earning his PhD in Electrical & Computer
            Engineering from the University of Arizona. Today, USAT is powered
            by a small team of dedicated engineers and researchers who challenge
            the limits of existing technology. Weâ€™re an ethical, results-driven,
            R&D-focused team with a deliberate desire to explore the uncharted.
